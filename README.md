# bluelight-special

Welcome to BlueLight Special. This application is intended to allow communities to organize neighborhood garage sale events. A list of sales is available to anyone who views the site. Creating, editing and deleting a sale requires authentication. Authenticated users also have access to a map of all sales through Google Maps Platform.

This application was created to meet the requirements for the final project in Flatiron Academy's Fullstack Web Development program.
